In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful.

Praise be to God Almighty for giving me the strength, knowledge, and ability to complete this internship, without his blessings, this achievement would not have been possible. And peace be upon our prophet Mohamed, his family, and all of his companions.

\bigskip

I would like to thank my supervisors Mrs. Imen Ayari, Mrs. Racha Friji and Mr. Ahmed ben Rouha for their invaluable support, patience, kindness, and motivation throughout my journey at Talan.

I would like to thank my beloved family, friends, and mates for their invaluable support and care. Hoping I can make them proud one day!
My heartfelt thanks to all the practitioners who have taken the time and effort to help me out.
