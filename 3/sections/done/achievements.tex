\chapter{Conclusion \& Achievements}


In the end of this internship, I have developed new understanding of Blockchain Technology. I had the chance to learn how Bitcoin, Ethereum \& Polygon work, Plus diving deep with concepts like The Cryptography behind them, Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Mining, Minting, Nonce... 
Which I believe they're an important part before starting digging into coding.
\\

\indent In Addition to the low level theory, I was introduced to implementations of many standards like \textbf{The Decentralized Autonomous Organization} (DAOs), \textbf{The Decentralized Identity} and \textbf{Marketplaces}. Those high level standards opened the door to teach me about different APIs that are provided by the developers community like the Access Control, ERC-20, ERC-721, Governance and Cryptography.
\\

\indent The weekly presentations and the daily team meetings and the benchmarking of different platforms helped me develop my public speaking skills, Leadership initiatives, Team Collaboration and finally Coming Up with the best solutions that fits the requirements.
\\

\indent Those Achievements were the results of The Internal mentorship of the team members, The Supervision of the Seniors, And of course the hard work.
\\

\indent Blockchain, Web3, Metaverse, DAOs, NFTs... are promising innovative initiatives to build the next generation of trust-proof softwares, I am sure I will be introduced more into those concepts and maybe build more solutions on those infrastructures \& standards.
